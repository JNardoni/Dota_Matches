# Dota Matches
Dota is a rediculously complicated game. With hundreds of moving parts, theres so much to keep track of.
But more importantly, queuing for a game decides the people you're stuck with for the next 35+ minutes. The players decide the game.
They decide what heroes to pick, what items to buy, what lane to go in. This script focuses on you, the user. It searches your history
to see if you've played with anyone in your current game before. It tells you more about them as players, and helps you get a better feel as you
embark in another beautiful match of DotA.
